The examples in this file were all tested using Windows 10 and the official C Sharp compiler "csc".

For example:

csc 1.cs && 1

Would compile and run the first example.

I don't know enough to understand them yet or why they work, but they do work for me and I am testing the waters of the C Sharp Programming Language to see if I like it or not.
